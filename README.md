## Our Design documentation:

## Design process
These were the steps we took in our design process:

1) Decided the two-way marketplace we were going to create was for expensive used shoes
2) Came up with our project plan and timeline, breaking down important tasks and adding them to our Trello board
3) Came up with our user stories
4) Created our wireframes
5) Designed our ERD
6) Built our App
7) Completed our Documentation
8) Completed our Styling
____________________________________________________________________________

## User stories
Here is a list of our User Stories that we created on our Trello Board:

![user stories page](docs/User_Stories.png "user stories page")

The following are future enhancements:

## Answers to the Short Answer questions (Section 2.2)

### (1) What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?

We have identified there is a need to buy and sell boutique used shoes in a convinient way online.

### (2) Identify the problem youâ€™re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving?

We have identified that many women have expensive shoes in their closet that they no longer need or want. We though a great way to clear out your closet and make some extra cash was to sell your used shoes online. 

### (3) Describe the project you will be conducting and how your App will address the needs.
An online store that allows a user to buy and sell boutique shoes at a reduced price in a easy manner. Users are able to add, edit and delete their listings. Users are able to find and purchase other people's listings.

### (4) Describe the network infrastructure the App may be based on.
We have used Heroku to deploy our app.

### (5) Identify and describe the software to be used in your App.

- Rails Framework
- Ruby and .erb files
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Heroku
- Bulma
- PostGresql
- JS

### (6) Identify the database to be used in your App and provide a justification for your choice.
We have used Postgres for our app's database.

### (7) Identify and describe the production database setup (i.e. postgres instance).

We used postgres for our database system 

### (8) Describe the architecture of your App.



### (9) Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your App.

### (10) Detail any third party services that your App will use.
1) Devise
  
    We used Devise for user login and signup authentication

2) Stripe

    We used Stripe for our secure online payment system

3) Cloudinary

    We used Cloudinary for user image upload

4) Heroku

    We used Heroku for our online deployment

### (11) Describe (in general terms) the data structure of marketplace apps that are similar to your own (e.g. eBay, Airbnb).

### (12) Discuss the database relations to be implemented.

### (13) Describe your projectâ€™s models in terms of the relationships (active record associations) they have with each other.

### (14) Provide your database schema design.
Here is our ERD:
![ERD](docs/ERD.png "ERD")

We do not have an orders model yet as this is a future enhancement once we have implemented our shopping cart


### (15) Provide User stories for your App.
Here is a list of our User Stories that we created on our Trello Board:

![user stories page](docs/User_Stories.png "user stories page")
____________________________________________________________________________

### (16) Provide Wireframes for your App.
Here are our Wireframes:

![wireframes page](docs/wireframes.png "wireframes page")
____________________________________________________________________________

### (17) Describe the way tasks are allocated and tracked in your project.
We broke up the major tasks with a project plan and timeline. We then created user stories and made sure we focused on completing our MVP first. Each morning we checked in with each other and decided which tasks each of us were going to complete for that day. We tracked our tasks and their priorities using our Trello Board. We also used Slack to communicate with each other.

### (18) Discuss how Agile methodology is being implemented in your project.
After our main app was setup and deployed to Heroku, we used the following steps to implement new functionalities:

1) Pull down master and create a new branch
2) Add new feature
3) Test the new feature works (using dummy text)
4) Push your branch up to GIT and merge with master 

### (19) Provide an overview and description of your Source control process.
Here are the steps we created and followed for using GitHub. (We added it into our Trello Board for easy reference too!):

![github steps](docs/GIT_Source_Control_Process.png "github steps")
____________________________________________________________________________

### (20) Provide an overview and description of your Testing process.
We used manual testing after adding each new feature. We also used rspec for our final testing. Here is the report of our test results:

### (21) Discuss and analyse requirements related to information system security.

### (22) Discuss methods you will use to protect information and data.
We used Devise, Cloudinary and Stripe in our app. They each have their own systems in place to protect our users information and data. 

### (23) Research what your legal obligations are in relation to handling user data.
We have a legal obligation to ensure that we protect our users information and personal data.
